# SQL-Challenge
For this project, I've designed tables to hold the data from CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. I've performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.


ChatGPT helped me with my assignment by teaching me "REFERENCES" and also teaching me the importance of order when importing CSV files because data relies on other tables for data.
